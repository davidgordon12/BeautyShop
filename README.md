# BeautyShop
A demo management system for maintaining products and procedures that I wrote for an assignment in my Programming Concepts class to showcase OOP principles.

#
Ideally, the items would be storeed in a text-file or database, but that was out of scope for this assignment, and I have done I/O and CRUD many times already, so I decided just to keep it simple this time
